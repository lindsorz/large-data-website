		<p><strong>Bioluminescence</strong> isn’t something made up in James Cameron’s <em>Avatar</em>; it does exist on Earth today. There are lots of living creatures that produce bioluminescence. What is bioluminescence? It literally means <em>light emitted from a living organism</em>; <em>bio</em>, Latin for life/living matter and <em>lumin</em>, Latin for light.</p>
